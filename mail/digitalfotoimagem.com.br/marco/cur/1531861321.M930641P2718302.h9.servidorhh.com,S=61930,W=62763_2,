=0A=E2=80=9CThe might of the Father of the Heavens The Wisdome of the Glori=
ous Son, And the goodnesse of the Holy Ghost three persons and one God be w=
ith vs now and ever Amen.=0A=0A=E2=80=9CGood Bretheren and Fellows our purp=
ose is to shew you how and in what manner this Noble and Worthy Craft of Ma=
sonry was first founded and begun, And afterwards how it was confirmed by w=
orthy Kings and Princes and by many other Worshipfull men, And also to all =
those the be heere, Weeminde to shewe you the Charge that belongs to every =
trew Mason to keep, for in good Faith if you take good heed it is well wort=
hy to be kept for A worthy Craft and curious Science. Srs there be Seaven L=
iberall Sciencies of which the Noble Craft of Masonry is one, And the Seave=
n be these, The first is Gramer and that teacheth A man to Spell and Write =
trewly. The second is Rethorick and that teacheth A man to speake faire and=
 Subtill, The third is Lodgick and that teacheth A man deserne the trew fro=
m the false, The ffowrth is Arethmatick and that teacheth A man to Reckon a=
nd Account all manner of Accompts, the fifth is Geometry and that teacheth =
A man=C2=A0 and Measur of Earth and of all things of the which this Science=
 is called Geometry, The sixth is called Musick, and that teacheth A man to=
 sing with Voyce and Tongue and Organ Harp and Trump, The Seaventh is calle=
d Astronemy and that teacheth A man to know the Course of the Sunn and the =
Moone and the Starrs, these be the Seaven Liberall Sciencies of the which a=
ll be founded by one which is Geometry, and thus a man, may prove that all =
the Seaven Sciencies be founde by Geometrie for it Teacheth A man=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 and Measure Ponderation weight on all things on Earth, F=
or there is noe Workman that Worketh any Craft but he worketh by some Mett =
or Measure. And every man that buyeth or Selleth they buy or Sell by some w=
eight or Measure, And all this is Geometry, And the Merchants and all other=
 Craftsmen of the Seaven Sciencies, and the Plowmen and Tillers of the Eart=
h and Sowers of all manner of Graines Seeds and Vine plants, and Setters of=
 all manner of ffruits: For Gramer or Arethmatick nor Astronomy nor none of=
 all the Seaven Sciencies can no man finde Mett or Measure in without Geome=
try wherefore methinks that the said Science of Geometry is most worthy. An=
d all the other be founded by it. But how this worthy Science and Craft was=
 first founded and begun I shall tell you before Noyes fflood there was A m=
an which was called Lameth as it is written in the Bible in the 4th Chapter=
 of Genesis, and this Lameth had 2 Wifes the one called Ada the other Sella=
, by the first wife Ada he begat a Sonne and a Daughter And these 4 Childre=
n found the begining of all these Crafts and Sciencies in the World flfor t=
he Eldest Sonne Gabell found the Craft of Geometry and he fed fflocks of Sh=
eep and Lambs in the ffeild: And first wrought houses of Stone and he and h=
is Brother Tuball found the Crafts of Musick song of mouth harp and Organs =
and all other Instruments. The third Brother Tubalican found the Smith Craf=
t of Gold and Silver Iron and Copper and Steel, And the Daughter found the =
Craft of Webbing and these Children knew well that God would take vengeance=
 for Sinn either by ffire or Water, wherefore they wrought the Scyences the=
y had founded in 2 Pillers of Stone, that they might be found afterwards, a=
nd the one Stone was called Marble for that would not burne in the ffire, a=
nd the other Stone was called Latherne and that would not be drowned with w=
ater; Our Intent is to tell you how and in what manner these Stones were fo=
und that these Sciencies was written on the Herminerus that was Cubb his So=
nne, The which Cubb. Semet. Sonne the which Sonne was Noaths Sonne this sam=
e Herminerus was afterwards called Armes the ffather of the Wisemen he foun=
d one of the 2 pillers of Stone and found the Science written therein and h=
e taught it to others, And at the makeing of the tower of Babilon, was Maso=
nrie first made there much of, and the King of Babilon called Nemroth who w=
as a Mason himselfe and loved well the rest as is said with the Masters of =
Stories, And when the City of Ninevey or the City of the East Port should h=
ave bin made Nemroth the King of Babilon sent thither Sixty Masons of his R=
egion to the King of Ninevey his cozen, And when he sent them forth he gave=
 them a Charge in this manner.=0A=0A=E2=80=9CThe first was that they should=
 be true to their King Lord or Master that they served and that they should=
e Ordaine the most wise and cunning man to be Master of the King or Lords w=
orke that was amongst them, and neither for Love Riches nor favour to sett =
another that had little cunninge to be Master of that Worke whereby the Lor=
d should bee ill served And the Science ill Defamed.=0A=0A=E2=80=9CSecondly=
 that they should call the Governor of the Worke Master all the tyme they w=
rought with him and other many more Charges that were to long to write, and=
 for the keeping of all those Charges he made them sware a great Oath which=
 men vsed at that time. And ordained for them reasonable pay that they migh=
t live with honestie, and also he gave them in Charge that they should Asse=
mble togather every yeare once to see how they might Worke best to serve th=
e King or Lord for their profitt and their owne Workship, And also that the=
y should correct within themselves those that had Trespassed against the Sc=
ience or Craft, And thus was this Noble Craft first grounded there, And the=
 worthy Mr Ewclides gave it the name of Geometry, And how it is called thro=
ughout all the World Masonrie Long after when the Children of Israell were =
come into the Land Berhest which is now called the Countrey of Jerusalem wh=
ere King David begun the Temple that is now called Templu Dei, and is named=
 with us the Temple of Jerusalem, and the same King David Loved Masons then=
 right well and gave them good pay, and he gave the Charges and Manners tha=
t he learned in Egipt which were given by that worthy Doctor Ewclid and oth=
er more charges that you shall heare after wardes; And after the decease of=
 King David, then Reigned Solloman that was King Davids Sound and he perfor=
med out the Temple that his ffather had begun and he sent after Masons into=
 Diverse Countreys and into Diverse Lands and he gathered them togeather so=
 that he had 24000 Workers of Stone and were all named Masons and he Chosed=
 out of them 3000 and were all ordained to be Masters, Rulers and Governors=
 of his worke, and then was there a King of another Region which men called=
 Iram and he loved well King Solloman and gave him Timber to his work and h=
e had a Sonne that was called a man that was Master of Geometry, and was ch=
iefe Master of all his Masonrie & of all his Graving, Carving and all other=
 Masonry that belonged to the Temple, this is Witnessed in the holy Bible (=
in Libro Regium quarto et Tertio) and this same Solloman Confirmed both the=
 Charges and the Manners which his ffather had given, And thus was the wort=
hy Craft of Masonrie confirmed in that countrey of Jerusalem And many other=
 Regions and Kingdoms men walked into Diverse Countreys some because of Lea=
rning to learne more Cunning, And some to teach them that had but little Cu=
nning, and soe it befell that there was a Curious man named Namas Greecious=
 who had beene at the makeing of Sollomans Temple And he came from thence i=
nto France and there he taught the Science of Masonrie to men of that Land =
and so there was one of the Royall Line of France called Charles Marshall a=
nd he was A man that loved well the said Craft and took upon him the Rules =
and Manners and after that By the Grace of God he was elect to be the King =
of ffrance and when he was in his Estate he helped to make those Masons tha=
t were now, and sett them on Work and gave them Charges and Manners and goo=
d pay as he had Learned of other Masons, and Confirmed them a Charter from =
yeare to yeare to hold their Assembly when they would and Cherished them ri=
ght well, and thus came this Noble craft into ffrance and England, in that =
season stood void as fforagine Charge of Masons vntill St. Albanes and St. =
Albans was a worthy Knight and Steward to the King of his household and had=
 Government of his Realme And also of the makeing of the Walls of the said =
Towne, and he loved well Masons and Cherished them much and made there pay =
right good for he gave them iijs vjd a week & iij d before that time all th=
e Land a Mason took but one penny a day and his meat till St. Albones mende=
d it and he gott them a Charter of the King and his Councell for to hold a =
Generall Councell and gave it to name Assembly. Thereat was he himselfe and=
 did help to make Masons and gave them Charges as you shall heare afterward=
s, soone after the Decease of St. Albones there came Diverse Warrs into Eng=
land out of Diverse Nations so that the good rule of Masons was dishired an=
d put downe vntill the tyme of King Adilston in his tyme there was a worthy=
 King in England that brought this Land into good rest and he builded many =
great workes and buildings, therefore he loved well Masons for he had a Son=
ne called Edwin the which Loved Masons much more then his ffather did and h=
e was soe practized in Geometry that he delighted much to come and talke wi=
th Masons and to Learne of them the Craft, And after for the love he had to=
 Masons and to the Craft, he was made Mason at Windsor and he gott of the K=
ing his ffather a Charter and Commission once every yeare to have Assembley=
 within the Realme where they would within England and to correct within th=
emselves ffaults & Trespasses that weere done as Touching the Craft, and he=
 held them an Assembley at Yorke and there he made Masons and gave them Cha=
rges and taught them the Manners, and Comands the same to be kept ever afte=
rwards And tooke them the Charter and Commission to keep their Assembly and=
 Ordained that it should be renewed from King to King, and when the Assembl=
ey were gathered togeather he made a Cry that all old Masons or young that =
had any Writeings or Vnderstanding of the Charges and manners that weere ma=
de before their Lands wheresoever they were made Masons that they should sh=
ew them forth, there were found some in ffrench, some in Greek some in Hebr=
ew and some in English, and some in other Languages, and when they were rea=
d and over seen well the intent of them was vnderstood to be all one, and t=
hen he caused a Booke to be made thereof how this worthy Craft of Masonrie =
was first founded and he himselfe Comanded and also then caused that it sho=
uld be read at any tyme when it should happen any Mason or Masons to be mad=
e to give him or them their Charges, and from that time vntill this Day Man=
ners of Masons have been kept in this Manner and forme as well as Men might=
 Governe it and ffurthermore at diverse Assemblyes have been put and Ordain=
ed diverse Charges by the best advice of Masters and ffellows (Tunc vnus ex=
 Senioribus tentat Librum et ille ponent manam Suam Super Librum) Every man=
 that is a Mason take good heede to these Charges, If any man finde himself=
e guilty in any of these Charges we pray that he may amend himselfe or prin=
cpially for dread of God you that be charged take good heede that you keep =

d in what manner this <em>Noble</em> and <em>Worthy</em> <em>Craft</em> of =
<em>Masonry</em> was first founded and begun, And afterwards how it was con=
firmed by worthy <em>Kings</em> and <em>Princes</em> and by many other Wors=
hipfull men, And also to all those the be heere, Weeminde to shewe you the =
Charge that belongs to every trew <em>Mason</em> to keep, for in good Faith=
 if you take good heed it is well worthy to be kept for A worthy Craft and =
curious <em>Science</em>. S<sup>rs</sup> there be <em>Seaven</em> <em>Liber=
all</em> <em>Sciencies</em> of which the <em>Noble</em> Craft of <em>Masonr=
y</em> is one, And the Seaven be these, The first is <em>Gramer</em> and th=
at teacheth A man to Spell and Write trewly. The second is <em>Rethorick</e=
m> and that teacheth A man to speake faire and Subtill, The third is <em>Lo=
dgick</em> and that teacheth A man deserne the trew from the false, The ffo=
wrth is <em>Arethmatick</em> and that teacheth A man to Reckon and Account =
all manner of Accompts, the fifth is <em>Geometry</em> and that teacheth A =
man=C2=A0 and Measur of Earth and of all things of the which this Science i=
s called <em>Geometry</em>, The sixth is called <em>Musick</em>, and that t=
eacheth A man to sing with Voyce and Tongue and Organ Harp and Trump, The S=
eaventh is called <em>Astronemy</em> and that teacheth A man to know the Co=
urse of the Sunn and the Moone and the Starrs, these be the Seaven <em>Libe=
rall</em> <em>Sciencies</em> of the which all be founded by one which is <e=
m>Geometry</em>, and thus a man, may prove that all the Seaven Sciencies be=
 founde by Geometrie for it Teacheth A man=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 and Meas=
ure Ponderation weight on all things on Earth, For there is noe Workman tha=
t Worketh any Craft but he worketh by some Mett or Measure. And every man t=
hat buyeth or Selleth they buy or Sell by some weight or Measure, And all t=
his is <em>Geometry</em>, And the Merchants and all other Craftsmen of the =
Seaven Sciencies, and the Plowmen and Tillers of the Earth and Sowers of al=
l manner of Graines Seeds and Vine plants, and Setters of all manner of ffr=
uits: For <em>Gramer</em> or <em>Arethmatick</em> nor <em>Astronomy</em> no=
r none of all the Seaven Sciencies can no man finde Mett or Measure in with=
out <em>Geometry</em> wherefore methinks that the said Science of <em>Geome=
try</em> is most worthy. And all the other be founded by it. But how this w=
orthy Science and Craft was first founded and begun I shall tell you before=
 <em>Noyes</em> fflood there was A man which was called <em>Lameth</em> as =
it is written in the Bible in the 4<sup>th</sup> Chapter of Genesis, and th=
is <em>Lameth</em> had 2 Wifes the one called <em>Ada</em> the other Sella,=
 by the first wife <em>Ada</em> he begat a Sonne and a Daughter And these 4=
 Children found the begining of all these Crafts and Sciencies in the World=
 flfor the Eldest Sonne <em>Gabell</em> found the Craft of Geometry and he =
fed fflocks of Sheep and Lambs in the ffeild: And first wrought houses of S=
tone and he and his Brother <em>Tuball</em> found the Crafts of <em>Musick<=
/em> song of mouth harp and Organs and all other Instruments. The third Bro=
ther <em>Tubalican</em> found the Smith Craft of Gold and Silver Iron and C=
opper and Steel, And the Daughter found the Craft of Webbing and these Chil=
dren knew well that God would take vengeance for Sinn either by ffire or Wa=
ter, wherefore they wrought the Scyences they had founded in 2 Pillers of S=
tone, that they might be found afterwards, and the one Stone was called Mar=
ble for that would not burne in the ffire, and the other Stone was called L=
atherne and that would not be drowned with water; <em>Our</em> Intent is to=
 tell you how and in what manner these Stones were found that these Scienci=
es was written on the <em>Herminerus</em> that was <em>Cubb</em> his Sonne,=
 The which <em>Cubb</em>. <em>Semet</em>. Sonne the which Sonne was <em>Noa=
ths</em> Sonne this same <em>Herminerus</em> was afterwards called <em>Arme=
s</em> the ffather of the Wisemen he found one of the 2 pillers of Stone an=
d found the Science written therein and he taught it to others, And at the =
makeing of the tower of <em>Babilon</em>, was <em>Masonrie</em> first made =
there much of, and the <em>King of Babilon</em> called Nemroth who was a Ma=
son himselfe and loved well the rest as is said with the Masters of Stories=
, And when the City of <em>Ninevey</em> or the City of the <em>East</em> <e=
m>Port</em> should have bin made <em>Nemroth</em> the <em>King of Babilon</=
em> sent thither Sixty <em>Masons</em> of his Region to the <em>King of Nin=
evey</em> his cozen, And when he sent them forth he gave them a Charge in t=
his manner.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font-size: 14px; line-height:=

 the Governor of the Worke Master all the tyme they wrought with him and ot=
her many more Charges that were to long to write, and for the keeping of al=
l those Charges he made them sware a great Oath which men vsed at that time=
. And ordained for them reasonable pay that they might live with honestie, =
and also he gave them in Charge that they should Assemble togather every ye=
are once to see how they might Worke best to serve the <em>King</em> or Lor=
d for their profitt and their owne Workship, And also that they should corr=
ect within themselves those that had Trespassed against the Science or Craf=
t, And thus was this Noble Craft first grounded there, And the worthy <em>M=
r Ewclides</em> gave it the name of Geometry, And how it is called througho=
ut all the World <em>Masonrie</em> Long after when the Children of Israell =
were come into the Land <em>Berhest</em> which is now called the Countrey o=
f Jerusalem where <em>King</em> <em>David</em> begun the Temple that is now=
 called <em>Templu Dei</em>, and is named with us the Temple of <em>Jerusal=
em</em>, and the same King David Loved Masons then right well and gave them=
 good pay, and he gave the Charges and Manners that he learned in Egipt whi=
ch were given by that worthy Doctor Ewclid and other more charges that you =
shall heare after wardes; And after the decease of <em>King</em> <em>David<=
/em>, then Reigned <em>Solloman</em> that was King Davids Sound and he perf=
ormed out the Temple that his ffather had begun and he sent after Masons in=
to Diverse Countreys and into Diverse Lands and he gathered them togeather =
so that he had 24000 Workers of Stone and were all named <em>Masons</em> an=
d he Chosed out of them 3000 and were all ordained to be Masters, Rulers an=
d Governors of his worke, and then was there a King of another Region which=
 men called <em>Iram</em> and he loved well <em>King</em> <em>Solloman</em>=
 and gave him Timber to his work and he had a Sonne that was called a man t=
hat was Master of Geometry, and was chiefe Master of all his Masonrie &amp;=
 of all his Graving, Carving and all other Masonry that belonged to the Tem=
ple, this is Witnessed in the holy Bible (in Libro Regium quarto et Tertio)=
 and this same <em>Solloman</em> Confirmed both the Charges and the Manners=
 which his ffather had given, And thus was the worthy Craft of <em>Masonrie=
</em> confirmed in that countrey of Jerusalem And many other Regions and Ki=
ngdoms men walked into Diverse Countreys some because of Learning to learne=
 more Cunning, And some to teach them that had but little Cunning, and soe =
it befell that there was a Curious man named <em>Namas Greecious</em> who h=
ad beene at the makeing of Sollomans Temple And he came from thence into Fr=
ance and there he taught the <em>Science of Masonrie</em> to men of that La=
nd and so there was one of the Royall Line of France called <em>Charles Mar=
shall</em> and he was A man that loved well the said Craft and took upon hi=
m the Rules and Manners and after that By the Grace of God he was elect to =
be the <em>King</em> of ffrance and when he was in his Estate he helped to =
make those Masons that were now, and sett them on Work and gave them Charge=
s and Manners and good pay as he had Learned of other Masons, and Confirmed=
 them a Charter from yeare to yeare to hold their Assembly when they would =
and Cherished them right well, and thus came this Noble craft into ffrance =
and England, in that season stood void as fforagine Charge of Masons vntill=
 St. Albanes and St. Albans was a worthy Knight and Steward to the King of =
his household and had Government of his Realme And also of the makeing of t=
he Walls of the said Towne, and he loved well Masons and Cherished them muc=
h and made there pay right good for he gave them iijs vjd a week &amp; iij =
d before that time all the Land a Mason took but one penny a day and his me=
at till St. Albones mended it and he gott them a Charter of the King and hi=
s Councell for to hold a Generall Councell and gave it to name Assembly. Th=
ereat was he himselfe and did help to make <em>Masons</em> and gave them Ch=
arges as you shall heare afterwards, soone after the Decease of St. Albones=
 there came Diverse Warrs into England out of Diverse Nations so that the g=
ood rule of Masons was dishired and put downe vntill the tyme of <em>King A=
dilston</em> in his tyme there was a worthy King in England that brought th=
is Land into good rest and he builded many great workes and buildings, ther=
efore he loved well Masons for he had a Sonne called <em>Edwin</em> the whi=
ch Loved Masons much more then his ffather did and he was soe practized in =
Geometry that he delighted much to come and talke with Masons and to Learne=
 of them the Craft, And after for the love he had to Masons and to the Craf=
t, he was made <em>Mason</em> at Windsor and he gott of the <em>King</em> h=
