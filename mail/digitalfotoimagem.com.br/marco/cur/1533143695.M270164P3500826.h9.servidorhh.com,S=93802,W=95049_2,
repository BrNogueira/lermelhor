=0A=0AAn appendix to 1984=0AWritten by : George Orwell =C2=A0- =C2=A01984 -=
=0A=0ANewspeak was the official language of Oceania, and had been devised t=
o meet the ideological needs of=C2=A0Ingsoc ( http://www.newspeakdictionary=
.com/ns-dict.html#Ingsoc ) , or English Socialism. In the year 1984 there w=
as not as yet anyone who used=C2=A0Newspeak ( http://www.newspeakdictionary=
.com/ns-dict.html#Newspeak ) =C2=A0as his sole means of communication, eith=
er in speech or writing. The leading articles of the=C2=A0Times=C2=A0were w=
ritten in it, but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out =
by a specialist, It was expected that Newspeak would have finally supersede=
d=C2=A0Oldspeak ( http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ns-dict.html#Oldspeak )=
 =C2=A0(or standard English, as we should call it) by about the=C2=A0year 2=
050 ( http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/go-movie.html#future ) . Meanwhile,=
 it gained ground steadily, all party members tending to use Newspeak words=
 and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech. The =
version in 1984, and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of Newspeak d=
ictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and =
archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the fi=
nal, perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the dictiona=
ry, that we are concerned here.=0A=0AThe purpose of Newspeak was not only t=
o provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits prope=
r to the devotees of IngSoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossi=
ble. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all a=
nd Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought -- that is, a thought diverging =
from the principles of IngSoc -- should be literally unthinkable, at least =
so far as thought is dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed =
as to give exact and often very subtle expression =C2=A0to every meaning th=
at a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other=
 meaning and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. =
This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminat=
ing undesirable words and stripping such words as remained of unorthodox me=
anings, and so far as possible of all secondary meaning whatever.=0A=0ATo g=
ive a single example - The word=C2=A0free ( http://www.newspeakdictionary.c=
om/ns-dict.html#free ) =C2=A0still existed in Newspeak, but could only be u=
sed in such statements as "The dog is=C2=A0free=C2=A0from lice" or "This fi=
eld is=C2=A0free=C2=A0from weeds." It could not be used in its old sense of=
 "politically free" or "intellectually free," since political and intellect=
ual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of neces=
sity nameless. Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical wor=
ds, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word t=
hat could be dispenses with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed n=
ot to extend but to=C2=A0diminish=C2=A0the range of thought, and this purpo=
se was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum=
. Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though ma=
ny Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly created words, would =
be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak words=
 were divided into three distinct classes, known as the=C2=A0A vocabulary (=
 http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ns-prin.html#A ) , the=C2=A0B vocabulary=
, and the=C2=A0C vocabulary. It would be simpler to discuss each class sepa=
rately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with=
 in the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good=
 for all three categories.=0A=0AThe=C2=A0A=C2=A0vocabulary. The A vocabular=
y consisted of words needed for the business of everyday life --- For such =
things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one's clothes, going up and=
 down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like. It was =
composed almost entirely of words that we already possess -- words like=
=C2=A0hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field=C2=A0-- but in comparison wi=
th the present-day English vocabulary, their number was extremely small, wh=
ile their meanings were far more rigidly defined. All ambiguities and shade=
s of meaning had been purged out of them. So far as it could be achieved, a=
 Newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing=C2=
=A0one=C2=A0clearly understood concept. It would have been quite impossible=
 to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosop=
hical discussion. It was intended only to express simple, purposive thought=
s, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.=0A=0AThe grammar=
 of Newspeak has two outstanding peculiarities. The first of these was an a=
lmost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech. Any wo=
rd in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract words s=
uch as=C2=A0if=C2=A0or=C2=A0when) could be used either as verb, noun, adjec=
tive, or adverb. Between the verb and noun form, when of the same root, the=
re was never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction o=
f many archaic forms. The word=C2=A0thought, for example, did not exist in =
Newspeak. Its place was taken by=C2=A0think, which did duty for both noun a=
nd verb. No etymological principle was involved here; in some cases it was =
the original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. E=
ven where a noun and a verb of kindred meanings were not etymologically con=
nected, one or other of them was frequently suppressed. There was, for exam=
ple, no such word as=C2=A0cut, its meaning being sufficiently covered by th=
e noun-verb=C2=A0knife. Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix=C2=
=A0-ful=C2=A0to the noun verb, and adverbs by adding=C2=A0-wise. Thus, for =
example,=C2=A0speedful=C2=A0meant "rapid" and=C2=A0speedwise=C2=A0meant "qu=
ickly." =C2=A0Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as=C2=A0good, str=
ong, big, black, soft,=C2=A0were retained, but their total number was very =
small. There was little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning =
could be arrived at by adding=C2=A0-ful=C2=A0to a noun-verb. None of the no=
w-existing adverbs was retained, except for a few already ending in=C2=
=A0-wise; the=C2=A0-wise=C2=A0termination was invariable. the word=C2=A0wel=
l, for example, was replaced by=C2=A0goodwise.=0A=0AIn addition, any word -=
- this again applied in principle to every word in the language -- could be=
 negative by adding the affix=C2=A0un-, or could be strengthened by the aff=
ix=C2=A0plus-, or, for still greater emphasis=C2=A0doubleplus-. Thus, for e=
xample, uncold meant "warm" while=C2=A0pluscold=C2=A0and=C2=A0doublepluscol=
d=C2=A0meant, respectively, "very cold" and "superlatively cold". It was al=
so possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of almost any=
 word by prepositional affixes such as=C2=A0ante-, post-, up-, down-, etc. =
By such methods it was possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vo=
cabulary. Given, for instance, the word=C2=A0good, there was no need for su=
ch a word as=C2=A0bad, since the required meaning was equally well --indeed=
 better-- expressed by=C2=A0ungood. All that was necessary, in any case whe=
re two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide which of the=
m to suppress.=C2=A0Dark, for example, could be replaced by=C2=A0Unlight, o=
r=C2=A0lightby=C2=A0undark, according to preference.=0A=0AThe second distin=
guishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity. Subject to a few exce=
ptions which are mentioned below, all inflections followed the same rules. =
Thus in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and e=
nded in=C2=A0-ed. The preterite of=C2=A0steal=C2=A0was=C2=A0stealed, the pr=
eterite of=C2=A0think=C2=A0was=C2=A0thinked, and so on throughout the langu=
age, all such forms asswam, gave, brought, spoke, taken,=C2=A0etc., being a=
bolished. All plurals were made by adding=C2=A0-s=C2=A0or=C2=A0-es=C2=A0as =
the case might be. The plurals of=C2=A0man, ox, life,=C2=A0were=C2=A0mans, =
oxes, lifes.=C2=A0Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding=
=C2=A0-er, -est=C2=A0(good, gooder, goodest), irregular forms and the=C2=
=A0more, most=C2=A0formation being suppressed.=0A=0AThe only classes of wor=
ds that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the re=
latives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of thes=
e followed their ancient usage, except that whom had been scrapped as unnec=
essary, and the=C2=A0shall, should=C2=A0tenses had been dropped, all their =
uses being covered by will and would. There were also certain irregularitie=
s in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A wo=
rd which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was=
 held to be ipso facto a bad word: occasionally therefore, for the sake of =
euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation wa=
s retained. But this need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the B =
vocabulary. Why so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciatio=
n will be made clear later in this essay.=0A=0AThe B vocabulary.=0A=0AThe=
=C2=A0B vocabulary=C2=A0consisted of words which had been deliberately cons=
tructed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not only had i=
n every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirab=
le mental attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding=
 of the principles of=C2=A0Ingsoc=C2=A0it was difficult to use these words =
correctly. In some cases they could be translated into Oldspeak, or even in=
to words taken from the=C2=A0A vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long=
 paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones. The B words =
were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a=
 few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordina=
ry language.=0A=0AThe B words were in all cases compound words.=0A=0AThey c=
onsisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in an =
easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb, an=
d inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the =
word=C2=A0goodthink, meaning, very roughly,=C2=A0'orthodoxy', or, if one ch=
ose to regard it as a verb,=C2=A0'to think in an orthodox manner'. This inf=
lected as follows: noun-verb,=C2=A0goodthink; past tense and past participl=
e,=C2=A0goodthinked; present participle,=C2=A0goodthinking; adjective,=
=C2=A0goodthinkful; adverb,=C2=A0goodthinkwise; verbal noun,=C2=A0goodthink=
er.=0A=0AThe=C2=A0B words=C2=A0were not constructed on any etymological pla=
n. The words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and c=
ould be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy t=
o pronounce while indicating their derivation. In the word=C2=A0crimethink=
=C2=A0(thoughtcrime), for instance, the=C2=A0think=C2=A0came second, wherea=
s in=C2=A0thinkpol=C2=A0(Thought Police) it came first, and in the latter w=
ord=C2=A0police=C2=A0had lost its second syllable. Because of the great dif=
ficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the=
=C2=A0B vocabulary=C2=A0than in the=C2=A0A vocabulary. For example, the adj=
ective forms of=C2=A0Minitrue, Minipax,=C2=A0and=C2=A0Miniluv=C2=A0were, re=
spectively,=C2=A0Minitruthful, Minipeaceful,=C2=A0and=C2=A0Minilovely, simp=
ly because=C2=A0-trueful,-paxful,=C2=A0and=C2=A0-loveful=C2=A0were slightly=
 awkward to pronounce. In principle, however, all=C2=A0B words=C2=A0could i=
nflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way.=0A=0ASome of the=C2=
=A0B words=C2=A0had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyo=
ne who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example, suc=
h a typical sentence from a Times leading article as=C2=A0Oldthinkers unbel=
lyfeel Ingsoc. The shortest rendering that one could make of this in Oldspe=
ak would be:=C2=A0'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution cann=
ot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English Sociali=
sm.'=C2=A0But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in order =
to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above, one would =
have to have a clear idea of what is meant by=C2=A0Ingsoc. And in addition,=
 only a person thoroughly grounded in=C2=A0Ingsoc=C2=A0could appreciate the=
 full force of the word=C2=A0bellyfeel, which implied a blind, enthusiastic=
 acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word=C2=A0oldthink, which=
 was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But t=
he special function of certain Newspeak words, of which=C2=A0oldthink=C2=
=A0was one, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These w=
ords, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they=
 contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were s=
ufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped a=
nd forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the=C2=A0News=
peak Dictionary=C2=A0was not to invent new words, but, having invented them=
, to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges o=
f words they cancelled by their existence.=0A=0A* Compound words such as=
=C2=A0speakwrite, were of course to be found in the=C2=A0A vocabulary, but =
these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological c=
olour.=0A=0AAs we have already seen in the case of the word=C2=A0free, word=
s which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the =
sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of t=
hem. Countless other words such as=C2=A0honour, justice, morality, internat=
ionalism, democracy, science,=C2=A0and=C2=A0religion=C2=A0had simply ceased=
 to exist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolish=
ed them. All words grouping themselves round the concepts of=C2=A0liberty=
=C2=A0and=C2=A0equality, for instance, were contained in the single word=
=C2=A0crimethink, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of=
 objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word=C2=A0oldthin=
k. Greater precision would have been dangerous. What was required in a Part=
y member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, wit=
hout knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshipped 'fal=
se gods'. He did not need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris,=
 Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knew about them the =
better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: =
he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were=
 false gods. In somewhat the same way, the party member knew what constitut=
ed right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what =
kinds of departure from it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was=
 entirely regulated by the two Newspeak wordssexcrime=C2=A0(sexual immorali=
ty) and=C2=A0goodsex=C2=A0(chastity).=C2=A0Sexcrime=C2=A0covered all sexual=
 misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and ot=
her perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practised for its own=
 sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all =
equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death. In the=C2=
=A0C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it migh=
t be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but=
 the ordinary citizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant by=C2=
=A0goodsex=C2=A0-- that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife,=
 for the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure =
on the part of the woman: all else was=C2=A0sexcrime. In Newspeak it was se=
ldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception tha=
t it was heretical: beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent.=
=0A=0ANo word in the=C2=A0B vocabulary=C2=A0was ideologically neutral. A gr=
eat many were euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as=C2=A0joycamp=C2=
=A0(forced-labour camp) or=C2=A0Minipax=C2=A0(Ministry of Peace, i. e. Mini=
stry of War) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean.=
 Some words, on the other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understa=
nding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An example was=C2=A0prolefeed,=
 meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party hande=
d out to the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connot=
ation 'good' when applied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to its enemie=
s. But in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight a=
ppeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour=
 not from their meaning, but from their structure.=0A=0ASo far as it could =
be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of a=
ny kind was fitted into the=C2=A0B vocabulary. The name of every organizati=
on, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public b=
uilding, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single=
 easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would pr=
eserve the original derivation. In the=C2=A0Ministry of Truth, for example,=
 the Records Department, in which Winston Smith worked, was called=C2=A0Rec=
dep, the Fiction Department was calledFicdep, the Teleprogrammes Department=
 was called=C2=A0Teledep, and so on. This was not done solely with the obje=
ct of saving time. Even in the early decades of the twentieth century, tele=
scoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of pol=
itical language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviat=
ions of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitaria=
n organizations. Examples were such words as=C2=A0Nazi, Gestapo, Comintern,=
 Inprecorr, Agitprop. In the beginning the practice had been adopted as it =
were instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. I=
t was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly al=
tered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would other=
wise cling to it.=0A=0AThe words=C2=A0Communist International, for instance=
, call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, ba=
rricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune. The wordComintern, on the other=
 hand, suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body =
of doctrine. It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as lim=
ited in purpose, as a chair or a table.=C2=A0Comintern=C2=A0is a word that =
can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas=C2=A0Communist Intern=
ational=C2=A0is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momen=
tarily. In the same way, the associations called up by a word like=C2=A0Min=
itrue=C2=A0are fewer and more controllable than those called up by=C2=A0Min=
istry of Truth. This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whene=
ver possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to ma=
ke every word easily pronounceable.=0A=0AIn Newspeak, euphony outweighed ev=
ery consideration other than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammar w=
as always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. And rightly so, since =
what was required, above all for political purposes, was short clipped word=
s of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused t=
he minimum of echoes in the speaker's mind. The words of the=C2=A0B vocabul=
ary=C2=A0even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were ve=
ry much alike. Almost invariably these words --=C2=A0goodthink, Minipax, pr=
olefeed, sexcrime, joycamp, Ingsoc, bellyfeel, thinkpol, and countless othe=
rs -- were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equ=
ally between the first syllable and the last. The use of them encouraged a =
gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was exa=
ctly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, and especially sp=
eech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible indepe=
ndent of consciousness.=0A=0AFor the purposes of everyday life it was no do=
ubt necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Pa=
rty member called upon to make a political or ethical judgment should be ab=
le to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun sp=
raying forth bullets. His training fitted him to do this, the language gave=
 him an almost foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with the=
ir harsh sound and a certain willful ugliness which was in accord with the =
spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.=0A=0ASo did the fact =
of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our own, the Newspeak =
vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devi=
sed. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other languages in that its v=
ocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year. Each reduction was a g=
ain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to ta=
ke thought. Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from th=
e larynx without involving the higher brain centers at all. This aim was fr=
ankly admitted in the Newspeak word=C2=A0duckspeak, meaning=C2=A0' to quack=
 like a duck'. Like various other words in the=C2=A0B vocabulary,=C2=A0duck=
speak=C2=A0was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the opinions which were=
 quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but praise, and when Th=
e Times referred to one of the orators of the Party as a=C2=A0doubleplusgoo=
d duckspeaker=C2=A0it was paying a warm and valued compliment.=0A=0AThe C v=
ocabulary.=0A=0AThe C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consis=
ted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the scienti=
fic terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the u=
sual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable me=
anings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other =
two vocabularies. Very few of the=C2=A0C words=C2=A0had any currency either=
 in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific worker or techni=
cian could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own spec=
iality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in =
the other lists. Only a very few words were common to all lists, and there =
was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a habit of mind, or=
 a method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches. There was, i=
ndeed, no word for=C2=A0'Science', any meaning that it could possibly bear =
being already sufficiently covered by the word=C2=A0Ingsoc.=0A=0AFrom the f=
oregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression of unortho=
dox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible. It was of c=
ourse possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of blasphe=
my.=0A=0AIt would have been possible, for example, to say=C2=A0Big Brother =
is ungood. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a s=
elf-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, =
because the necessary words were not available. Ideas inimical to=C2=A0Ings=
oc=C2=A0could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only =
be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole grou=
ps of heresies without defining them in doing so. One could, in fact, only =
use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of =
the words back into Oldspeak. For example,=C2=A0All mans are equal=C2=A0was=
 a possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which=C2=A0All=
 men are red-haired=C2=A0is a possible Oldspeak sentence.=0A=0AIt did not c=
ontain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpable untruth-i.e. that a=
ll men are of equal size, weight, or strength. The concept of political equ=
ality no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been pu=
rged out of the word=C2=A0equal. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the norma=
l means of communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using Ne=
wspeak words one might remember their original meanings. In practice it was=
 not difficult for any person well grounded in=C2=A0doublethink=C2=A0to avo=
id doing this, but within a couple of generations even the possibility of s=
uch a lapse would have vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his s=
ole language would no more know that=C2=A0equal=C2=A0had once had the secon=
dary meaning of'politically equal', or that=C2=A0free=C2=A0had once meant=
=C2=A0'intellectually free', than for instance, a person who had never hear=
d of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to=C2=A0queen=
and=C2=A0rook. There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyo=
nd his power to commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore uni=
maginable. And it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the dist=
inguishing characteristics of Newspeak would become more and more pronounce=
d -- its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid,=
 and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing.=0A=0AW=
hen Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with the p=
ast would have been severed. History had already been rewritten, but fragme=
nts of the literature of the past survived here and there, imperfectly cens=
ored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge of Oldspeak it was possib=
le to read them. In the future such fragments, even if they chanced to surv=
ive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable. It was impossible to trans=
late any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred to som=
e technical process or some very simple everyday action, or was already ort=
hodox(goodthinkful would be the Newspeak expression) in tendency. In practi=
ce this meant that no book written before approximately 1960 could be trans=
lated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to i=
deological translation -- that is, alteration in sense as well as language.=
 Take for example the well-known passage from the=C2=A0Declaration of Indep=
endence:=0A=0AWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are cre=
ated equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable=
 rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. =
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men, deriving=
 their powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of G=
overnment becomes destructive of those ends, it is the right of the People =
to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government. . .=0A=0AIt would =
have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while keeping to th=
e sense of the original. The nearest one could come to doing so would be to=
 swallow the whole passage up in the single word=C2=A0crimethink. A full tr=
anslation could only be an ideological translation, whereby Jefferson's wor=
ds would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.=0A=0AA good de=
al of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being transformed in =
this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memo=
ry of certain historical figures, while at the same time bringing their ach=
ievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc. Various writers, such as=
 Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some others were therefore=
 in process of translation: when the task had been completed, their origina=
l writings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, woul=
d be destroyed. These translations were a slow and difficult business, and =
it was not expected that they would be finished before the first or second =
decade of the twenty-first century. There were also large quantities of mer=
ely utilitarian literature -- indispensable technical manuals, and the like=
 -- that had to be treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order to allo=
w time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of N=
ewspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.=0A=0AGeorge Orwell=0A=0A=

expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of I=
ngSoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended t=
hat when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,=
 a heretical thought -- that is, a thought diverging from the principles of=
 IngSoc -- should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is d=
ependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and o=
ften very subtle expression =C2=A0to every meaning that a Party member coul=
d properly wish to express, while excluding all other meaning and also the =
possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly b=
y the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words =
and stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as =
possible of all secondary meaning whatever.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: lt=

 only be used in such statements as "The dog is=C2=A0<i>free</i>=C2=A0from =
lice" or "This field is=C2=A0<i>free</i>=C2=A0from weeds." It could not be =
used in its old sense of "politically free" or "intellectually free," since=
 political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and=
 were therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from the suppression of =
definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end =
in itself, and no word that could be dispenses with was allowed to survive.=
 Newspeak was designed not to extend but to=C2=A0<i>diminish</i>=C2=A0the r=
ange of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the ch=
oice of words down to a minimum. Newspeak was founded on the English langua=
ge as we now know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even when not contain=
ing newly created words, would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker=
 of our own day. Newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes, k=
nown as the=C2=A0<i><a style=3D"text-decoration: underline; color: #2585B2;=
"  href=3D"http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ns-prin.html#A">A vocabulary</=
a></i>, the=C2=A0<i>B vocabulary</i>, and the=C2=A0<i>C vocabulary</i>. It =
would be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical pecu=
liarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the A=
 vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.</p>=

ary consisted of words needed for the business of everyday life --- For suc=
h things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one's clothes, going up a=
nd down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like. It wa=
s composed almost entirely of words that we already possess -- words like=
=C2=A0<i>hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field</i>=C2=A0-- but in compar=
ison with the present-day English vocabulary, their number was extremely sm=
all, while their meanings were far more rigidly defined. All ambiguities an=
d shades of meaning had been purged out of them. So far as it could be achi=
eved, a Newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing=
=C2=A0<i>one</i>=C2=A0clearly understood concept. It would have been quite =
impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for political o=
r philosophical discussion. It was intended only to express simple, purposi=
ve thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.</p>=0A=

4; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; m=
argin: 0 0 1em;">The grammar of Newspeak has two outstanding peculiarities.=
 The first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between diffe=
rent parts of speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied e=
ven to very abstract words such as=C2=A0<i>if=C2=A0</i>or=C2=A0<i>when</i>)=
 could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb. Between the verb=
 and noun form, when of the same root, there was never any variation, this =
rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word=
=C2=A0<i>thought</i>, for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was=
 taken by=C2=A0<i>think</i>, which did duty for both noun and verb. No etym=
ological principle was involved here; in some cases it was the original nou=
n that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. Even where a noun=
 and a verb of kindred meanings were not etymologically connected, one or o=
ther of them was frequently suppressed. There was, for example, no such wor=
d as=C2=A0<i>cut</i>, its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-ve=
rb=C2=A0<i>knife</i>. Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix=C2=A0<i>-=
ful=C2=A0</i>to the noun verb, and adverbs by adding=C2=A0<i>-wise</i>. Thu=
s, for example,=C2=A0<i>speedful=C2=A0</i>meant "rapid" and=C2=A0<i>speedwi=
se=C2=A0</i>meant "quickly." =C2=A0Certain of our present-day adjectives, s=
uch as=C2=A0<i>good, strong, big, black, soft,=C2=A0</i>were retained, but =
their total number was very small. There was little need for them, since al=
most any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding=C2=A0<i>-ful=
=C2=A0</i>to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained, ex=
cept for a few already ending in=C2=A0<i>-wise</i>; the=C2=A0<i>-wise</i>=
=C2=A0termination was invariable. the word=C2=A0<i>well</i>, for example, w=
as replaced by=C2=A0<i>goodwise</i>.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font=
-size: 14px; line-height: 1.4em; color: #444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica =
Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;">In addition, an=
y word -- this again applied in principle to every word in the language -- =
could be negative by adding the affix=C2=A0<i>un-</i>, or could be strength=
ened by the affix=C2=A0<i>plus-</i>, or, for still greater emphasis=C2=
=A0<i>doubleplus-</i>. Thus, for example, uncold meant "warm" while=C2=
=A0<i>pluscold</i>=C2=A0and=C2=A0<i>doublepluscold</i>=C2=A0meant, respecti=
vely, "very cold" and "superlatively cold". It was also possible, as in pre=
sent-day English, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional=
 affixes such as=C2=A0<i>ante-, post-, up-, down-</i>, etc. By such methods=
 it was possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary. Given=
, for instance, the word=C2=A0<i>good</i>, there was no need for such a wor=
d as=C2=A0<i>bad</i>, since the required meaning was equally well --indeed =
better-- expressed by=C2=A0<i>ungood</i>. All that was necessary, in any ca=
se where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide which =
of them to suppress.=C2=A0<i>Dark</i>, for example, could be replaced by=
=C2=A0<i>Unlight</i>, or=C2=A0<i>light</i>by=C2=A0<i>undark</i>, according =
to preference.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font-size: 14px; line-heig=

 Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;">The second distinguishing mark of New=
speak grammar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions which are men=
tioned below, all inflections followed the same rules. Thus in all verbs th=
e preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in=C2=A0<i>-ed<=
/i>. The preterite of=C2=A0<i>steal=C2=A0</i>was=C2=A0<i>stealed</i>, the p=
reterite of=C2=A0<i>think</i>=C2=A0was=C2=A0<i>thinked</i>, and so on throu=
ghout the language, all such forms as<i>swam, gave, brought, spoke, taken,=
=C2=A0</i>etc., being abolished. All plurals were made by adding=C2=A0<i>-s=
=C2=A0</i>or=C2=A0<i>-es</i>=C2=A0as the case might be. The plurals of=
=C2=A0<i>man, ox, life,=C2=A0</i>were=C2=A0<i>mans, oxes, lifes.=C2=A0</i>C=
omparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding=C2=A0<i>-er, -est</i>=
=C2=A0(<i>good, gooder, goodest</i>), irregular forms and the=C2=A0<i>more,=
 most</i>=C2=A0formation being suppressed.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr=

classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pr=
onouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verb=
s. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that whom had been scr=
apped as unnecessary, and the=C2=A0<i>shall, should</i>=C2=A0tenses had bee=
n dropped, all their uses being covered by will and would. There were also =
certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid =
and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be i=
ncorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word: occasionally theref=
ore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an=
 archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt chiefly in =
connexion with the B vocabulary. Why so great an importance was attached to=
 ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.</p>=0A<p sty=

cabulary</i>=C2=A0consisted of words which had been deliberately constructe=
d for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in ever=
y case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirable men=
tal attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding of th=
e principles of=C2=A0<i>Ingsoc</i>=C2=A0it was difficult to use these words=
 correctly. In some cases they could be translated into Oldspeak, or even i=
nto words taken from the=C2=A0<i>A vocabulary</i>, but this usually demande=
d a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones. The =
B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of idea=
s into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible tha=
n ordinary language.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font-size: 14px; lin=

or portions of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form. The =
resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the or=
dinary rules. To take a single example: the word=C2=A0<i>goodthink</i>, mea=
ning, very roughly,=C2=A0<i>'orthodoxy'</i>, or, if one chose to regard it =
as a verb,=C2=A0<i>'to think in an orthodox manner'</i>. This inflected as =
follows: noun-verb,=C2=A0<i>goodthink</i>; past tense and past participle,=
=C2=A0<i>goodthinked</i>; present participle,=C2=A0<i>goodthinking</i>; adj=
ective,=C2=A0<i>goodthinkful</i>; adverb,=C2=A0<i>goodthinkwise</i>; verbal=
 noun,=C2=A0<i>goodthinker</i>.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font-size=

quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;">The=C2=A0<i>B words<=
/i>=C2=A0were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of which =
they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any =
order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indi=
cating their derivation. In the word=C2=A0<i>crimethink</i>=C2=A0(thoughtcr=
ime), for instance, the=C2=A0<i>think</i>=C2=A0came second, whereas in=
=C2=A0<i>thinkpol</i>=C2=A0(Thought Police) it came first, and in the latte=
r word=C2=A0<i>police</i>=C2=A0had lost its second syllable. Because of the=
 great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner i=
n the=C2=A0<i>B vocabulary</i>=C2=A0than in the=C2=A0<i>A vocabulary</i>. F=
or example, the adjective forms of=C2=A0<i>Minitrue, Minipax,=C2=A0</i>and=
=C2=A0<i>Miniluv</i>=C2=A0were, respectively,=C2=A0<i>Minitruthful, Minipea=
ceful,</i>=C2=A0and=C2=A0<i>Minilovely</i>, simply because=C2=A0<i>-trueful=
,-paxful,</i>=C2=A0and=C2=A0<i>-loveful</i>=C2=A0were slightly awkward to p=
ronounce. In principle, however, all=C2=A0<i>B words</i>=C2=A0could inflect=
, and all inflected in exactly the same way.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: l=

 the=C2=A0<i>B words</i>=C2=A0had highly subtilized meanings, barely intell=
igible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, fo=
r example, such a typical sentence from a Times leading article as=C2=A0<i>=
Oldthinkers unbellyfeel Ingsoc</i>. The shortest rendering that one could m=
ake of this in Oldspeak would be:=C2=A0<i>'Those whose ideas were formed be=
fore the Revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the princ=
iples of English Socialism.'</i>=C2=A0But this is not an adequate translati=
on. To begin with, in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sente=
nce quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by=
=C2=A0<i>Ingsoc</i>. And in addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in=
=C2=A0<i>Ingsoc</i>=C2=A0could appreciate the full force of the word=C2=
=A0<i>bellyfeel</i>, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance difficu=
lt to imagine today; or of the word=C2=A0<i>oldthink</i>, which was inextri=
cably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the special f=
unction of certain Newspeak words, of which=C2=A0<i>oldthink</i>=C2=A0was o=
ne, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words, ne=
cessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they contain=
ed within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were sufficien=
tly covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped and forgo=
tten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the=C2=A0<i>Newspeak =
Dictionary</i>=C2=A0was not to invent new words, but, having invented them,=
 to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of=
 words they cancelled by their existence.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr;=

 Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;">As we have alr=
eady seen in the case of the word=C2=A0<i>free</i>, words which had once bo=
rne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience=
, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Countless othe=
r words such as=C2=A0<i>honour, justice, morality, internationalism, democr=
acy, science,</i>=C2=A0and=C2=A0<i>religion</i>=C2=A0had simply ceased to e=
xist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished th=
em. All words grouping themselves round the concepts of=C2=A0<i>liberty</i>=
=C2=A0and=C2=A0<i>equality</i>, for instance, were contained in the single =
word=C2=A0<i>crimethink</i>, while all words grouping themselves round the =
concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word=
=C2=A0<i>oldthink</i>. Greater precision would have been dangerous. What wa=
s required in a Party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient =
Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his=
 own worshipped 'false gods'. He did not need to know that these gods were =
called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he =
knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the comma=
ndments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or o=
ther attributes were false gods. In somewhat the same way, the party member=
 knew what constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized=
 terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible. His sexual li=
fe, for example, was entirely regulated by the two Newspeak words<i>sexcrim=
e</i>=C2=A0(sexual immorality) and=C2=A0<i>goodsex</i>=C2=A0(chastity).=
=C2=A0<i>Sexcrime</i>=C2=A0covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered=
 fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addit=
ion, normal intercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to en=
umerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in prin=
ciple, all punishable by death. In the=C2=A0<i>C vocabulary</i>, which cons=
isted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to give spec=
ialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had n=
o need of them. He knew what was meant by=C2=A0<i>goodsex</i>=C2=A0-- that =
is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of=
 begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman=
: all else was=C2=A0<i>sexcrime</i>. In Newspeak it was seldom possible to =
follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretica=
l: beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent.</p>=0A<p style=

f Peace, i. e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact opposite of what the=

ntemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An example =
was=C2=A0<i>prolefeed</i>, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious =
news which the Party handed out to the masses. Other words, again, were amb=
ivalent, having the connotation 'good' when applied to the Party and 'bad' =
when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of wo=

ad or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the=
=C2=A0<i>B vocabulary</i>. The name of every organization, or body of peopl=
e, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public building, was invaria=
bly cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily pronounced w=
ord with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original =
derivation. In the=C2=A0<i>Ministry of Truth</i>, for example, the Records =
Department, in which Winston Smith worked, was called=C2=A0<i>Recdep</i>, t=
he Fiction Department was called<i>Ficdep</i>, the Teleprogrammes Departmen=
t was called=C2=A0<i>Teledep</i>, and so on. This was not done solely with =
the object of saving time. Even in the early decades of the twentieth centu=
ry, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic feature=
s of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use a=
bbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and tot=
alitarian organizations. Examples were such words as=C2=A0<i>Nazi, Gestapo,=
 Comintern, Inprecorr, Agitprop</i>. In the beginning the practice had been=
 adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with a consc=
ious purpose. It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowe=

mething almost as easily recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair =
or a table.=C2=A0<i>Comintern</i>=C2=A0is a word that can be uttered almost=
 without taking thought, whereas=C2=A0<i>Communist International</i>=C2=
=A0is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In=
 the same way, the associations called up by a word like=C2=A0<i>Minitrue</=
i>=C2=A0are fewer and more controllable than those called up by=C2=A0<i>Min=
istry of Truth</i>. This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating w=
henever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken t=
o make every word easily pronounceable.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; f=

 euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. R=
egularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. =
And rightly so, since what was required, above all for political purposes, =
was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapi=
dly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker's mind. The words=
 of the=C2=A0<i>B vocabulary</i>=C2=A0even gained in force from the fact th=
at nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably these words -=
-=C2=A0goodthink, Minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joycamp, Ingsoc, bellyfeel,=
 thinkpol, and countless others -- were words of two or three syllables, wi=
th the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. =
The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and=
 monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The intention was to m=
ake speech, and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral,=
 as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.</p>=0A<p style=3D"dire=

>For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes =
necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to ma=
ke a political or ethical judgment should be able to spray forth the correc=
t opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His tr=
aining fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof ins=
trument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain=
 willful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted t=

 Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;">So did the fact of having =
very few words to choose from. Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary=
 was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised. Newsp=
eak, indeed, differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary =
grew smaller instead of larger every year. Each reduction was a gain, since=
 the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought=
. Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx w=
ithout involving the higher brain centers at all. This aim was frankly admi=
tted in the Newspeak word=C2=A0<i>duckspeak</i>, meaning=C2=A0<i>' to quack=
 like a duck'</i>. Like various other words in the=C2=A0<i>B vocabulary</i>=
,=C2=A0<i>duckspeak</i>=C2=A0was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the o=
pinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but p=
raise, and when The Times referred to one of the orators of the Party as a=
=C2=A0<i>doubleplusgood duckspeaker</i>=C2=A0it was paying a warm and value=
d compliment.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font-size: 14px; line-heigh=

tirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the scientific te=
rms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual c=
are was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings=
. They followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vo=
cabularies. Very few of the=C2=A0<i>C words</i>=C2=A0had any currency eithe=
r in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific worker or techn=
ician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own spe=
ciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in=
 the other lists. Only a very few words were common to all lists, and there=
 was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a habit of mind, o=
r a method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches. There was, =
indeed, no word for=C2=A0<i>'Science'</i>, any meaning that it could possib=
ly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word=C2=A0<i>Ingsoc</i>.<=

ewspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was =
well-nigh impossible. It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very=
 crude kind, a species of blasphemy.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font=

een possible, for example, to say=C2=A0<i>Big Brother is ungood</i>. But th=
is statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absur=
dity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the neces=
sary words were not available. Ideas inimical to=C2=A0<i>Ingsoc</i>=C2=
=A0could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be na=
med in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of=
 heresies without defining them in doing so. One could, in fact, only use N=
ewspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the w=
ords back into Oldspeak. For example,=C2=A0<i>All mans are equal</i>=C2=
=A0was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which=
=C2=A0<i>All men are red-haired</i>=C2=A0is a possible Oldspeak sentence.</=

if; margin: 0 0 1em;">It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expres=
sed a palpable untruth-i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or stre=
ngth. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this seconda=
ry meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word=C2=A0<i>equal</i>. I=
n 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the dang=
er theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might remember th=
eir original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for any person well=
 grounded in=C2=A0<i>doublethink</i>=C2=A0to avoid doing this, but within a=
 couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vani=
shed. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more =
know that=C2=A0<i>equal</i>=C2=A0had once had the secondary meaning of<i>'p=
olitically equal'</i>, or that=C2=A0<i>free</i>=C2=A0had once meant=C2=
=A0<i>'intellectually free'</i>, than for instance, a person who had never =
heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to=C2=
=A0<i>queen</i>and=C2=A0<i>rook</i>. There would be many crimes and errors =
which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply because they were name=
less and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be foreseen that with the pa=
ssage of time the distinguishing characteristics of Newspeak would become m=
ore and more pronounced -- its words growing fewer and fewer, their meaning=
s more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses alwa=
ys diminishing.</p>=0A<p style=3D"direction: ltr; font-size: 14px; line-hei=
ght: 1.4em; color: #444; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica=
, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 0 1em;">When Oldspeak had been once and for =
all superseded, the last link with the past would have been severed. Histor=
y had already been rewritten, but fragments of the literature of the past s=
urvived here and there, imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained o=
ne's knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible to read them. In the future such=
 fragments, even if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and un=
translatable. It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into N=
ewspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very si=
mple everyday action, or was already orthodox(goodthinkful would be the New=
speak expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written =
before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary=
 literature could only be subjected to ideological translation -- that is, =
alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known pa=
ssage from the=C2=A0<i>Declaration of Independence</i>:</p>=0A<p style=3D"d=

 Dickens, and some others were therefore in process of translation: when th=

ived of the literature of the past, would be destroyed. These translations =
were a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would=
 be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century.=
 There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian literature -- indis=
pensable technical manuals, and the like -- that had to be treated in the s=
